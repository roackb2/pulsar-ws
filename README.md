# pulsar-ws

This is a node.js library for Apache Pulsar with communication over WebSocket.

# Motivation

Current Apache Pulsar libraries are wrappers over C++ client library, which adds difficulties
for cross-platform deployment. Using WebSocket, this library becomes pure JavaScript
and need no C++ client library installation anymore.

# Examples

See examples folder.
